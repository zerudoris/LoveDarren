				Im really shy to say something like this and i dont even know why i made this web but I just wanna say that i like u so much and i will never give up on you. Im still wondering why i like you that much even though u dont like me back :(	
				<br> 
				<br> But i will wait until you like me back. Even if its take so long but i dont want anyone else except you and i know im so stupid. U make me change myself, i learn to care with my people around me, i learn to tidy, i really change myself because of you, even though u dont ask it but i truly did for you because i felt like i dont deserve you yet. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I know ure not gonna chat me either way and i know u dont even care about it but i just wanna let you know.
				<br>
				<br>
				If u change ur mind about my offer the other day, u know my contact. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Tell ur parents i said Hi.
